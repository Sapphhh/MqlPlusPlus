C++ has been my favorite language for a while now. Despite its popularity due to its speed and capabilities of memory management, MetaQuotes  has never released an official API so the users could work with it.

Well, if it was a problem for someone, it is no longer.

MQL++ allows the user fetch the data from the Metatrader5 terminal to work with it directly with it, aswell as to send orders to the trade server via C++ code.

In simple terms, the MQL++ library calls the functions exposed by the Python API provided by MetaQuotes, which are just a bunch of C functions under the hood.
